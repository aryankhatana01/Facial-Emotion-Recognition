# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
This is a random project I made while practicing my Deep Learning skills on Kaggle.

Link of the Dataset:- [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge)

I trained this model for just 5-7 minutes on a basic architecture and got an accuracy of 65%. You can improve this model a lot by trying:
- Data Augmentation
- Learning Rate Scheduling
- Earlystopping
- Different model architecture etc

**Note: I could not provide the saved model because the file was greater than 25Mb, so it could not be uploaded to github. You'll have to train the model first using the Python Notebook (All The BestüòÅ).**
